## Tech stack

- [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org/) - static site generator
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - icons

## TODO

- [ ] Tech stack is completely outdated and I would need to migrate to a more simple static site. Currently the only way to build the project is to downgrade to node 16.12.0 :/.
- [ ] Add analytics
