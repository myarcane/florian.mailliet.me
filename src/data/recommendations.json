I worked with him for almost 10 years in Dailymotion Video Player team; first as a peer front-end engineer, then lately as his direct manager.  He is one of the most reliable front-end engineer I had the chance to work with. Always commited to deliver high-quality product, able to dig into really complex technical topics, come-up with a clean solution that will fit the needs. In addition, he‚Äôs always eager to share his knowledge with his team and stakeholders. He was a trustable teammate over the years and demonstrated his skills on many occasions, would that be on the codebase itself or through his collaborations with stakeholders in other teams such as Product, Design, Backend or Data. I recommend him without any hesitation. ‚Äù","title":"Engineering Director @ Dailymotion"},{"name":"Michael Vial","link":"https://ca.linkedin.com/in/michael-vial?trk=public_profile_recommendations","content":"‚ÄúI've worked with Florian on the Dailymotion HTML5 player during 3 years and I've really appreciated his sense of details. He is the kind of person to fully size a problem before working on a solution, ensuring every scenarios will be handled properly. Whenever he was working on a UX feature, he makes sure to provide the best experience to user, with a particular attention to performance so it doesn't feel laggish.  Doing a user interface that works on every mobile browsers, including some low-end devices stuck with Chrome 30, in a country where EDGE connection is the norm, is not an easy task.
